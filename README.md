# Robo-Clench-Design-
This robo clench design was created for an informal competition hosted by BHP Goa on January 16, 2022.<br>
Objective: Make a clench mechanism to pick up cubical boxes in a clench bot arena.<br>Our Bot contains a parallel gripper clench which is connected to a shaft that enables the bot to turn 360 degrees.
<br><br>
Design Drawings for each part of the Clench:
